# Breast Cancer Detection Algorithm (Machine Learning)

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive breast cancer detection algorithm developed using Machine Learning techniques, including Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees. The algorithm aims to provide accurate and early detection of breast cancer, contributing to improved diagnosis outcomes.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), SVM, and Decision Trees to build a robust breast cancer detection algorithm.

- **High Accuracy**: The algorithm demonstrates high accuracy in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors, contributing to early and accurate diagnosis.

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Conducts a thorough analysis of the dataset, feature engineering, and model evaluation to ensure reliable and consistent results.

## Project Structure

- `breast_cancer_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the breast cancer detection algorithm. This includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and analysis.

## How to Use

1. Open the `breast_cancer_detection.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

2. Follow the step-by-step instructions to run the code and train the breast cancer detection models.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Results

- **Model Performance**: Include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for each machine learning model.

- **Visualizations**: Provide visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves to showcase the performance of the breast cancer detection algorithm.
